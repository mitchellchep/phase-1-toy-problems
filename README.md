In script_gradegen.js, I have written code for determining grade of a user depending on the range of their marks.
The code has a function that prompts the user to input student marks.
the output should correspond with the correct grade as follows;
        A-greater than 79
        B-60 to 79
        C-59 to 49
        D-40 to 49
        E-less than 40

In script_speeddet.js, the program takes the speed of a car as input. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok.".
If the speed exceeds 70, for every additional 5km one demerit point is given and the total number of demerit points is printed. When the driver exceeds 12 demerit points, their license is suspended and the program prints "License suspended.".

In script_netsalrycalc.js, the program calculates an indivudual's Net salary by getting the inputs of the basic salary and benefits. The payee(i.e., Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary and net salary are also calculated using Kenya's KRA platform standards.

In script_extraquiz.js, there are 3 programs as follows:
a.)The first one writes a function that takes an array of numbers as input and outputs the arrays sorted in ascending order.
b.)The second one creates a function that takes an integer and console logs a step shaped stair with the integer levels using the # character.
c.)The final one writes a program to get the volume of a cylinder to four decimal places using object classes.
